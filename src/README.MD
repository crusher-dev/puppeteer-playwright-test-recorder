## Philosophy
We believe testing should be easy. The lack of good tool out there makes it difficult. We want to make test creation both easy yet powerful things.

In the age where we have no code solutions coming up, there should be a seamless way to keep your software stable without writing code.

P.S.- Also, writing task is chore, and we want to make it easy for you.
